# Arduino Eskateboard Remote
[Full Project (including skateboard build)](http://ilikebuildingthings.com/3DPrintSkateboard.html)

This is the code for an arduino wiimote that was used with an electric skateboard.  One file is for the remote and the other is for the transceiver on the skateboard itself.
